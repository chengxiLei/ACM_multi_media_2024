                    <p class="bold600"> Submission Site: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMAsia2024">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMAsia2024</a>. </p>
                    <span class="bold600"> Paper format: </span> Submitted papers (.pdf format) must use the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Article Template</a>. Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords. Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. Word users please use <span class="bold700b">"interm-layout.docx"</span>, and Latex users please use <span class="bold700b">"sample-sigconf.tex"</span> to format your submissions.
                    
                    <br><br><span class="bold600"> Length: </span> Papers must be <span class="bold700r">no longer than 6 pages</span>, including all text and figures. There is no limit to the pages of references.
                    <br><br><span class="bold600"> Blinding: </span> Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors. Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors.
                    <br> Do not put the authors' names under the title. Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors. Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs). Check supplemental material (e.g., titles in the video clips, or supplementary documents) for information that may identify the authors' identities. Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Papers without appropriate blinding will be desk rejected without review.
                    <br><br><span class="bold600"> Originality: </span> Papers submitted to ACM Multimedia Asia 2024 must be the original work of the authors. The may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere. Publications that have been peer-reviewed and have appeared at other conferences or workshops may not be submitted to ACM Multimedia Asia 2024 (see also the arXiv/Archive policy below). Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview">plagiarism and self-plagiarism</a>. The authors' prior work must be cited appropriately.
                    <br><br><span class="bold600"> Author list: </span> Please ensure that you submit your papers with the full and final list of authors in the correct order. The author list registered for each submission is not allowed to change in any way after the paper submission deadline. (Note that this rule regards the identity of authors, e.g., typos are correctable.)
                    <br><br><span class="bold600"> Proofreading: </span> Please proofread your submission carefully. It is essential that the language used in the paper is clear and correct so that it is easily understandable. (Either US English or UK English spelling conventions are acceptable.)
                    <br><br><span class="bold600"> ArXiv/archive policy:  </span> In accordance with ACM guidelines, all SIGMM-sponsored conferences adhere to the following policy regarding arXiv papers:
                    <br>We define a publication as a written piece documenting scientific work that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, has been accepted. Documentation of scientific work that is published in a not-for-profit archive without any form of peer-review (departmental Technical Report, arXiv.org, etc.) is not considered a publication. However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in formal proceedings. Any submission to ACM Multimedia must not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other work currently undergoing peer review anywhere.
                    <br><br>Note that documents published on website archives are subject to change. Citing such documents is discouraged. Furthermore, ACM Multimedia will review the documents formally submitted and any additional information in a web archive version will not affect the review.

                    

                    <span class="h3"> <br><br>Review Process <hr> </span>Each submission will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, adhering to the reviewer guidelines.
                    <br>We do not have a rebuttal process for this year.

                    <span class="h3"> <br><br>Publication <hr> </span>The conference proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to the published work.
                    <br>Please download the PDF version of the ACM MM Asia 2024 flyer.
