                        ACM Multimedia Asia is calling for proposals for Grand Challenges in 2024. Proposers with an innovative idea of a Multimedia Grand Challenge, should gather an organizational team with the capacity to carry out the organization of a challenge, and submit a proposal according to the instructions below.

                        The purpose of the Multimedia Grand Challenge is to engage the multimedia research community by establishing well-defined and objectively judged challenge problems intended to exercise the state-of-the-art methods and inspire future research directions. The key criteria for Grand Challenges are that they should be useful, interesting, and their solution should involve a series of research tasks over a long period of time, with pointers towards longer-term research.
                    </p>
